                        Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but
                        cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other
                        desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
